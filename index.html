				<h1>Hi! I'm Arunav.</h1>
				<p>
					I’m a senior at UC San Diego studying Data Science and Math, passionate about machine learning, 
					its theoretical foundations, and its applications to urban design.
				</p>
				<p>
					When I’m not melting GPUs, you can find me exploring San Diego, making coffee, 
					and watching motorsport.
